## About the group

The Polyquantique research group led by Nicolás Quesada specializes in quantum photonics and quantum information. The group is looking for highly motivated candidates at the *PhD* level with interest and expertise in theoretical quantum optics.

We are a theory group with a significant computational component that collaborates closely with experimental groups and partners in government and industry. We write [open source code](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/open-science-basics/open-research-software-and-open-source) and do [reproducible science](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/2018/09/19/reproducible-computational-science/).  

We are based in beautiful and welcoming Montréal, a safe but never boring city that consistently ranks as the best city in North America to be a student.

## About the PhD position

As part of the QuantaMole consortium, we are interested in studying novel materials with extremely high nonlinearities, as well as their application as potential mediators of interactions between photons. A significant no-go result in this field is 
that ["Single-photon Kerr nonlinearities do not help quantum computation"](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.73.062305). We are interested in going beyond this result and study other geometries, configurations and topologies in which new materials can provide the sought-after interactions. This might include resonating geometries, utilizing χ<sup>(2)</sup> nonlinearities instead of χ<sup>(3)</sup>, and new states of light in which to apply these nonlinear operations with more success.

## Interested in joining?

We hope the selected candidates will join the group towards the end of 2024/early 2025. Please submit your application by email (using the email address at the bottom) with the subject line: "Quantamole Applicant: [Name]", and include the following information:

1. A motivation letter (2 pages max.) describing your research interests, background and experience. 

2. A curriculum vitae.

3. The *names* of two researchers familiar with the applicant's work, willing to provide a letter of reference.
